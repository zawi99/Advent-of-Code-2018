# Advent of Code 2018

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

This year I decided to try to solve as many problems as I can with help of Python 3. It helps me to further familiarize with Python and problem-solving.
